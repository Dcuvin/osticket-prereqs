<h1>osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation</h1>

This lab is done on Windows 10 Pro  with a VM made on Azure. The necessary installation files that are referenced and used are located <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6">here!</a><br />

Since Iam using a mac, I have gone ahead and installed Microsoft Remote Desktop from the app store in order to SSH into the VM. I will then copy and paste the IP address of my virtual machine into Microsoft Remote Desktop and attempt to connect from there.
